# Two-Player Goofy Chess Game 

## Overview

Welcome to the Two-Player Goofy Chess Game, a unique and fun twist on the classic game of chess. Designed for two players, this game combines the traditional elements of chess with a light-hearted approach, making it accessible and enjoyable for players of all skill levels.
I created this chess game as a personal project to combine my love for chess with my passion for programming. While there are many chess games out there, I wanted to create something that stands outâ€”something a bit more casual and "goofy" that could bring smiles and laughter to friends and family. This project has been a great opportunity to refine my Python and Pygame skills while creating a game that is both challenging and entertaining.

## Game Features

- **Two-Player Mode**: Play against a friend locally on the same computer.
- **Classic Chess Rules with a twist**: All the traditional rules of chess apply, but there are no checks, any piece can take the king without a check!
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear visual indicators show valid moves, captures, and when a player is in check.
- **Capturing Display**: Captured pieces are displayed on the side of the board for easy tracking.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To play the game, you need Python and Pygame installed on your computer. Follow these steps to set up your environment:

1. **Python Installation**: Make sure you have Python installed. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Pygame Installation**: Install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

### Running the Game

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**: Get a copy of this repository on your local machine.

2. **Navigate to the Game Directory**: Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the game files are located.

3. **Run the Game Script**: Execute the following command to start the game:

   ```bash
   python chess_game.py
   ```

   Make sure to replace `chess_game.py` with the actual name of your script if it's different.

### Controls

- **Mouse Clicks**: Use the mouse to select and move pieces.
- **Restart**: Press "ENTER" after a game is over to restart.

### Rules and Gameplay

The game follows standard chess rules with each player taking turns to move their pieces. Pieces move according to their traditional rules (e.g., rooks move in straight lines, bishops in diagonals, etc.). The game ends when one player's king is captured, or a player chooses to forfeit.

### Visual Feedback

- **Red/Blue Borders**: Indicate selected pieces.
- **Flashing Squares**: Highlight the king if it's in check.
- **Valid Moves**: Show dots for all valid moves of a selected piece.
